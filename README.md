### Markdown Preview App

This is a simple application to write common GitHub markdown text and see in live the preview.

Fun fact: this **README** was written with the help of this app :)

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

- The markdown conversion was done by installing [react-marked-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-marked-markdown) and importing the following:
```
import { MarkdownInput, MarkdownPreview } from 'react-marked-markdown';
```

- Styling was done using [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
